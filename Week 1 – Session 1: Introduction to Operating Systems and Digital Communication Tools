In today’s session, our instructor began by asking us to open our laptops and mentioned different types such as Macs, Windows, and one more that I didn’t remember at the time. This led to a class discussion on operating systems (OS) and how they define the type of laptop or computer we use. .and I learned that laptops are categorized based on the operating system they run. The three main types discussed were:
Windows – most commonly used OS by Microsoft.


macOS – used exclusively on Apple’s MacBooks.


Linux – open-source OS, popular among developers and tech professionals.
I also came across another type called Chromebooks that run on Chrome OS, primarily used for online tasks.i did some research to understand the concepts better on the Operating Systems (OS).
 I found some interesting Content on  An Operating System that is like the brain  of a computer.
 It connects and controls all parts:
Hardware (mouse, screen, keyboard)


Software (apps like Chrome, Word)
Without an OS, none of the apps or hardware would work together.
I also researched  that why OS is important. I got to know that 
Helps users interact with the computer (user interface)


Manages memory and processing

Allows apps to run smoothly
I remembered by creating some funny analogy to remember for a longer term . like 


If a computer were a restaurant:
Hardware = kitchen tools


Software = recipes/dishes


Operating System = the chef who makes it all work!


We also learned about how emails work, especially:
CC (Carbon Copy): To keep someone in the loop (everyone can see CC’d addresses).


BCC (Blind Carbon Copy): To send emails without showing recipients to others (good for privacy).


She also discussed that how to send the mail to multiple people at a time ,”Create a mail merge with Gmail & Google Sheets”
Reflection
I understood the types of laptops better by linking them with their operating systems. Exploring how the OS works helped me see my own laptop in a more technical way.
 Learning about CC and BCC also improved my understanding of email communication, which is important for professional settings.
