Week 6 - Session 1
Date: 18-Feb-2025
Time: 12:00 PM – 1:30 PM
Topic: Class Presentations - Learning by Observation

Today’s session was focused on presentations. Two groups presented their assigned topics during the
class:
● Group 1: Led by Deepika and team
● Group 2: Led by Nirmal and team

While I was presenting today, I spent the session carefully observing how each group delivered their
presentation , from how they communicated their ideas to how they handled their slides and
interaction with the audience.

Here are the some Key Learnings from the Presentations:

One of the most important takeaways from today was the importance of preparation. I noticed that
when a presenter kept looking at the laptop screen repeatedly, it gave the impression that they were not
fully prepared or confident with their material. This made me realize that:

      ● Even if you spend a lot of time preparing a PPT, it doesn’t have much value if you cannot
        confidently present it.
      ● Constantly referring to the screen distracts the audience and reduces the speaker’s connection
        with them.
Another thing I understood was that during a presentation, it's not enough to just read slides or
memorize lines. You need to be fully aware of your content, because the instructor might ask a
question from any part of your topic. You should be able to respond without hesitation. This means
truly understanding your material and being able to speak about it, not just recite it.

Some Practical Learnings from Peers
I also learned a few practical and technical skills today:
   
● How to change slides without touching the keyboard: Deepika demonstrated a smooth way to
navigate slides hands-free. This is useful because it allows the presenter to focus on speaking
rather than interrupting their flow to switch slides manually. I want to learn how to do this
myself for future presentations.

● What is HDMI and where to find it: I came across the term HDMI today and now I understand
that it stands for High-Definition Multimedia Interface. It is the port used to connect a laptop or other device to a projector or external display. 

Here is my Summary of today's session.

Today’s class helped me learn not only by watching the presentations but also by reflecting on the
behavior, preparation, and delivery of my peers. I understood that confidence, preparation, and
knowing your material thoroughly are just as important as the slides themselves. I also learned a few
helpful technical tips that I can use in my own future presentations. These lessons will be useful as I
prepare for my group’s upcoming session.
