Topic: Binary System – Quiz and Practice

In this session, we had an offline quiz based on binary number systems. The quiz tested our understanding of
converting between binary and decimal, two’s complement representation, and working with 8-bit binary
numbers. It was a practical application of everything we’ve been learning about how computers process data
using binary digits (0s and 1s).

Some questions were straightforward, especially the conversions from binary to decimal and vice versa.
However, I made a few mistakes with the two’s complement representation, especially where negative
numbers were involved. This helped me realize which parts I need to practice more.

Topics Covered in the Quiz:
1. Binary to Decimal Conversion
We were asked to convert binary numbers like 100101, 1111111, and 11010 to decimal form. For example:
● 100101 in binary = 37
● 1111111 in binary = 127
● 11010 in binary = 26

The process involves multiplying each bit by a power of 2 and summing them from right to left.

2. Decimal to Binary Conversion
Some questions asked us to convert decimal numbers like 7, 13, 25, and 100 into binary.

For example:
● 7 = 00000111 (8-bit format)
● 13 = 1101
● 25 = 11001
● 100 = 1100100

This requires dividing the number by 2 repeatedly and recording the remainders in reverse order

3. Two’s Complement Representation
Several questions focused on representing negative integers in 8-bit two’s complement form. These were a bit
more challenging.
Examples included:
● -20 = 11101100
● -5 = 11111011
To get the two’s complement, we convert the positive value to binary, invert the bits, and add 1.

4. Two’s Complement to Decimal
We also had to reverse the process: converting 8-bit two’s complement numbers back to decimal.
Examples:
● 11111100 = -4
● 11111010 = -6

In these questions, it’s important to recognize that if the first bit is 1, the number is negative, and we have to
apply the two’s complement process in reverse to find the original value.

My Performance and Reflection
I answered many of the questions correctly, especially those related to direct binary - decimal conversion.
However, I got a few questions wrong, particularly involving negative binary numbers in two’s complement.
This showed me that while I understand the basic concepts, I still need more practice with binary operations
that involve sign handling and 8-bit formatting.

What helped me most was breaking down the questions step-by-step and understanding why each answer
was correct or incorrect after reviewing them.

Here is my Summary of today's session.
This quiz was a great way to apply what I’ve been learning about binary systems in real scenarios. It helped
reinforce my understanding of binary to decimal conversion, two’s complement representation, and how
numbers are stored and processed in computers. I now know which topics I need to focus more on, especially
negative numbers in binary and 8-bit formats. I plan to practice more examples and revisit two’s complement
rules to gain full confidence.
