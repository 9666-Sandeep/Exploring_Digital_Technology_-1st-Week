Week 13 - Session 1
Date: 15-Apr-2025
Time: 12:00 PM – 1:30 PM
Topic: Group Planning for Final Presentation - Airline Reservation Systems


In today’s session, our class focused on group planning and preparation for the upcoming
presentations. Me and my groupmates sat together and discussed how to divide and work on our
respective topics. We began by outlining our goals and sharing initial ideas to see how we could bring
a structured and meaningful presentation from a technological perspective.

I selected the topic “Research the History of Airline Reservation Systems”. After discussing with my
group, we agreed to explore the evolution of the airline booking process ,right from the time when
reservations were done manually, to the modern systems powered by digital platforms and global
networks. The idea is to show how technology has gradually shaped and improved the airline industry
over time.

During our discussion, we also touched on the concept of overbooking tickets. We realized that while
it might seem like a problem from a passenger’s point of view, it is actually a strategy that benefits
airlines. Overbooking helps create artificial demand, allows better seat utilization, and can sometimes
result in higher pricing ,thus increasing revenue for the airline. This was an interesting insight and
helped us connect our topic more closely to real-world business practices in the travel industry.

To support the development of my part of the presentation, I also began collecting relevant sources
and background information. Some of the helpful resources I found included:

          1.  Timeline: The History of Airline Reservation Systems
          2. Wikipedia: Airline Reservations System
          3 . History of Flight Booking: CRSs, GDS Distribution, Travel Agencies, and Online Reservations

These sources provide a solid foundation for understanding how early reservation systems operated,
how CRSs (Central Reservation Systems) and GDSs (Global Distribution Systems) emerged, and how
online and mobile platforms changed the way we book flights today.

Here is my Summary of today's session

This session was mainly about coordination, research planning, and discussion. I felt that it was a
productive step toward building a strong and informative presentation. We aligned our goals as a team,
and I personally got more clarity on how I want to approach my topic from both historical and
technological angles. I'm now moving into the research phase and will begin organizing my slides and
points for the next sessions.
