In today's session, we discussed some foundational concepts in computing: hardware, software, operating systems, applications, and how computers understand our input. Initially, I found it difficult to understand the difference between hardware and software, but things became clearer through class discussion and further research outside class.

So ,What I Learned
1. Hardware
Hardware refers to the physical parts of a computer ,anything you can touch.
 Examples include the keyboard, CPU, monitor, mouse, hard drive, etc.

2. Software
Software is a set of instructions or programs that tell the hardware what to do.
 Examples include operating systems, applications like Microsoft Word, Zoom, or games.

3. Operating System (OS)
The operating system is the main software that manages everything on a computer. It connects hardware and applications, runs the system smoothly, and provides the user interface.
 Examples of OS for computers include Windows, macOS, and Linux.
 For mobile phones, common OS are Android and iOS.

4. Applications (Apps)
Applications are software programs used for specific tasks.
Examples: Chrome for browsing, Word for writing, WhatsApp for messaging.

How They Are Connected actually 

Hardware is the machine itself.
The operating system sits on the hardware and manages it.
Applications run on the operating system to perform specific functions.

For example, on a phone:
1. Hardware includes the screen, battery, and processor.
2.The OS is Android or iOS.
3.Apps include YouTube, Instagram, and the Camera.


A Doubt I Had About Operating Systems

I asked whether the operating system is also considered software.
 Our instructor clarified that yes, the OS is indeed software but it is the main software.
 Everything else, including applications and tools, runs on top of the OS.
 The OS also controls the hardware and helps all other software run efficiently.

And then my next discussion on how a Computer Understands Input 
Computers work using a language called binary, which is made up of only two values: 1 and 0.
1.1 represents ON (electricity is flowing)
2.0 represents OFF (no electricity)

This binary language is the only thing the computer's hardware can understand.
So When we interact with a computer, for example by pressing a key:

1.The keyboard sends an electrical signal.
2.The signal is converted into binary using a system like ASCII.
For example, the letter "A" becomes 01000001.
3.The CPU (Central Processing Unit) processes this binary using millions of tiny switches called transistors.
The processed result is shown on the screen or saved as data.


I asked her one more question Why Binary Is Used
Anuradha answers that Binary is simple and reliable. Computers work using transistors, which act as switches:

1.ON (1) = High voltage
2.OFF (0) = Low voltage

This system is easier for electronic circuits to manage, making it efficient and error-resistant.

Here is my best to understand it better 
1.I press the "A" key on the keyboard.
2.It gets converted to binary (01000001).
3.The CPU processes it.
4.The OS tells the screen to display the letter "A".

In this session, I learned the difference between hardware and software, understood the role of operating systems and applications, and explored how they all connect.
 I also gained a better understanding of how computers process input using binary and voltage signals inside electronic circuits.
