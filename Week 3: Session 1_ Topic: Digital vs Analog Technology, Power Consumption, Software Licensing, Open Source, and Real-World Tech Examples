In today’s class, we explored several different aspects of technology, starting with a discussion on digital and analog technologies. This was a new area for me, and it helped me understand how computers, devices, and older machines function at a basic level.

I learned that digital technology uses binary signals (0s and 1s) to represent information. Everything is converted into binary code and then processed. Examples of digital technologies include computers, smartphones, digital clocks, and even audio-video files like MP3s or MP4s.

In contrast, analog technology uses continuous signals. These signals can take on any value and vary smoothly, such as the hands on an analog clock or sound signals in old radios. Older thermometers and vinyl records are also good examples of analog systems.

This comparison helped me clearly see the shift in the world from analog to digital systems and how that impacts performance, reliability, and data handling.

Our instructor brought up the idea that “today’s technologies are low-powered,” which led to an explanation about how modern devices are designed to be energy-efficient. Low-powered technologies use less electricity while still performing well. Examples include smartphones with battery-saving features, LED lighting, and energy-efficient computers or wearables.
I learned that the shift to low-power design is important because:
   1.It improves battery life
   2.Reduces electricity bills
   3.Supports environmentally friendly technology use
   4.Helps portable and IoT devices function with minimal power


The discussion helped me appreciate how today's technologies are optimized not just for speed or design, but also for power usage.

Later in the session, the instructor mentioned buying a license for a certain software. This introduced me to the concept of software licensing, which is a legal agreement that gives a user permission to use specific software, usually for a fee. Licensed software often comes with restrictions, like usage limits or time periods.

She also said that the software “does not get antivirus,” which I understood to mean that the license doesn’t include antivirus protection. This means that even with paid software, separate antivirus software is still necessary to protect the system from malware or harmful programs.
I now understand that even legally purchased software isn’t necessarily protected from cyber threats unless antivirus tools are installed separately.

Following this, we touched on open-source software, which is different from licensed software. Open-source software is free to use, and its code is available to everyone. Users can view, modify, or share it. It’s maintained by a community rather than a company, and it’s often developed collaboratively by volunteers. This helped me see the contrast between commercial and community-driven software development models.

A Mention of NVIDIA

Although I didn’t fully hear what the instructor said about NVIDIA, I realized it might have been related to either graphics hardware or AI processing. NVIDIA is known for making powerful GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), which are used in gaming, design, machine learning, and AI applications. It's possible the mention was tied to performance or technology trends in hardware.

She has talked one Example: Elevators and Power Usage in My Hostel

The most interesting part of the session was a real-life example involving our hostel building, which has 40 floors and uses elevators installed by the ThyssenKrupp company. I had assumed elevators don’t consume much power, but I learned that they actually use a lot of electricity because:

   1.They lift heavy loads (people + the elevator cabin)
   2.They need powerful motors for speed and precision
   3.They often operate continuously throughout the day


The instructor explained that such systems require high energy, and getting approval from the government for large-scale electricity consumption can be difficult. The power needed for elevator systems in such buildings falls under commercial power, which is meant for businesses, hotels, schools, and hostels. This differs from industrial power, which is used in factories and manufacturing plants.

We also discussed that our hostel uses generators to support power demands. Generators work by burning fuel like diesel to produce electricity, usually used as backup when the power supply is limited or inconsistent. While effective, they are expensive and not eco-friendly.

It was also mentioned that our hostel isn’t involved in bribery or shortcuts, and it gets its power legally, even when using private generators. This made the conversation feel very real and practical, especially when connecting technology use to real infrastructure and power systems.

 Here is my Summary of today's session.

In this session, I learned the difference between digital and analog technologies and how modern devices are shifting toward energy efficiency. I gained an understanding of software licensing, open-source software, and why antivirus protection isn’t always included with purchased software. I also appreciated the practical example of elevator systems in large buildings and how they tie into concepts like power consumption and infrastructure challenges.
